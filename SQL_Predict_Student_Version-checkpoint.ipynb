    "\n",
    "_Note: sqlite does not always enforce foreign key constraints (and it is even more inconsistent with magic commands to enforce FK constraints!), so it is critical that you understand the purpose of the foreign key constraint and therefore are able to enforce the FK constraint yourself!_\n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce data integrity, and to ensure that strange things cannot happen - we will have a FK constraint. A foreign key forces all values of the FK, to be limited to only the values which exist as entries in the PK column of the table for which the aforementioned table is a foreign key to. For example, we cannot sell a product (in our Transactions table) which we do not have in our Products table. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to work around this by removing the erroneous data from the tables before continuing, since this would violate the FK constraint between the Transactions_2NF and Products_2NF table otherwise. \n",

    "\n",
    "For all tables which are going to be used, consider the table utility relative to the Products (Products_2NF) table. You are tasked with removing 'useless' entries as you take the data from 1NF to 2NF. For the sake of ease-of-use for the client, we will removing all rows in the 2NF tables `PackageContents_2NF` and `Colours_2NF` which have an empty value for the attributes that the client will use them for - these are the `ItemDescription` and `Colour` columns, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint: Make inserts into the other 2NF (`PackageContents_2NF` and `Colours_2NF`) tables using a `where` clause to remove instances of the value being an empty string, or a `null` value. This will need to be considered for the `ItemDescription` and for the `Colour` when data is inserted into the corresponding tables above (i.e. only insert data into the `PackageContents_2NF` which has a value for the `ItemDescription`, and only insert data into the `Colours_2NF` table which has a value for `Colour`_"
